## Why is this project important?

Survey software is difficult to evaluate because there is a high up-front cost to trying out each application: learning to use each application can be time-consuming, deficiencies may not be apparent until after significant time investment, and switching is essentially impossible after data have been collected.

The goal of this project is to make it easy to compare popular survey software without having to try each application yourself.

## Transparency

No sponsorship or other compensation was accepted for reviewing these survey applications. The source of this website, including a full change log, is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/masnick/survey-review).
