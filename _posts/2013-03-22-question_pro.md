pros:
  - "Free for universities and non-profits"
  - "Powerful"
  - "Relatively easy to use (interface is not super clean, but it is intuitive)"
  - "Good help docs, searchable and integrated with interface"
cons:
  - "Missing a few key features (piping that isn't tied to branching; using free text responses in survey logic). Would have scored a lot better without these relatively minor feature omissions."
  - "Interface is functional but dated."
