<h2>Why is this project important?</h2>

<p>Survey software is difficult to evaluate because there is a high up-front cost to trying out each application: learning to use each application can be time-consuming, deficiencies may not be apparent until after significant time investment, and switching is essentially impossible after data have been collected.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to make it easy to compare popular survey software without having to try each application yourself.</p>

<h2>Transparency</h2>

<p>No sponsorship or other compensation was accepted for reviewing these survey applications. The source of this website, including a full change log, is available <a href="https://github.com/masnick/survey-review">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Who did the reviews?</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.maxmasnick.com">Max Masnick</a> reviewed the survey software. He is a epidemiology PhD student at the <a href="http://epidemiology.umaryland.edu">University of Maryland Baltimore</a> and a software developer with substantial experience with survey software.</p>
