title: Evaluation criteria
---

<p>
  Each online survey application will be evaluated in the following categories on a scale from 0 (major deficiencies) to 3 (exceptional). These criteria indicates the characteristics associated with the numerical ratings for each category.
</p>

<p>
  For example, the "question types" category ranges from 0 ("Missing core question types, e.g. no 'select one' question") to 3 (basic and advanced question types, plus the ability to embed images/YouTube videos in the survey).

<h2>Test survey</h2>

<p>
  A test survey was constructed to test a number of these criteria. Each survey application was tested by recreating this survey through their interface.

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>
  Scores are calculated by adding up the points earned in each category and dividing by the total number of points possible. Scores are then normalized be out of 100 points.
