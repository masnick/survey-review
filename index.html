    <strong>The Survey Software Review</strong> is a systematic, independent review of online survey software. We focus on fully hosted online survey software for distributing surveys via email. Our evaluations are based on a set of <a href="/criteria">well-defined criteria</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Survey software is difficult to evaluate because there is a high up-front cost to trying out each application: learning to use each application can be time-consuming, deficiencies may not be apparent until after significant time investment, and switching is essentially impossible after data have been collected.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal of this project is to make it easy to compare popular survey software without having to try each application yourself.

      <h4>Best features</h4>
      <p>
        <strong><a href="/reviews/qualtrics/">Qualtrics</a></strong> (92/100) had the best features and user interface out of all the software reviewed. Highly recommended if you can afford it.

      <h4>Best value</h4>
      <p><a href="/reviews/survey_gizmo"><strong>Survey Gizmo</strong></a> (86/100) does not match Qualtrics for ease of use, but it offers almost the same feature set at about half the price.</p>
